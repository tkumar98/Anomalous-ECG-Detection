# Anomalous-ECG-Detection
A small project as part of my journey into deep learning. In this project I have implemented and trained an autoencoder to distinguish between normal and abnormal ECG data (Anomaly detection/Unsupervised learning). I have usedthe open-source \textit{ECG5000} dataset to perform the analysis.
